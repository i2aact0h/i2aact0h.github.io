						Dear mom and dad, the times that you saw me struggle and have cheered me on are now worth it. <br>

				with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, you have supported me through it all. Thank you both.

                       I have both learned to love and hate people. I have realized that we are all capable of both great good and even greater evil. I have lost my faith in my fellow man for sometime.<br>
                       Mom and dad, thank you for teaching me that we are all sinners and that we humans need to work together to build a better society together. You taught me the value of trust and of the power<br>
                       of restraint towards the evil and cruel. Thank you for teaching me forgiveness and to trust in the few good men and women left.
