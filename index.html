						Dear bro, there are times that you ask me for help in your schoolwork and for advice in dealing with your schoolmates. I want you to know that<br>
         all of my advice and helping was the cause of my own experiences. I told you these things so that you may become wiser than I was when I was your age.

              Though I taught you many things, you taught me things as well. How to be more caring, more understanding of people. I also learned somthing very valuable from you:<br>
              Passion. Although you were always generally unmotivated, you always worked your butt off doing things that meant the world to you. Because of you, I learned to have a<br>
              little passion in my life too.

						It is beacuse of your life and your naivete that challenged me to be a good brother. We always fought and argued, but know that I meant well for you.<br>
            I know you meant the same.
